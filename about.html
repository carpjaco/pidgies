        <h2>About</h2>
        <p class="description">
            This is a calculator to determine the most efficient action to take with your Pidgies in Pokemon Go. To use it, simply enter
            the number of Pidgies and Pidgy candies that you have, then click the pokeball. Calculated instructions are then
            displayed below the pokeball. If you plan to transfer the resulting Pidgeotto for an additional candy, leave the option to
            "Transfer after evolving?" on, and it will consider that in the calculation.

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <p class="faq">How does this calculator work?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">It simply figures out how many pidgies can evolve before you don't have enough candies left, but gives you
                the number of pidgies you'll have left up-front.</p>
        <p class="faq">How is this better than just evolving them on my own?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">You may have pidgies in your inventory that can be evolved if you transfer a few more. You can recognize
                this on your own, but the complexity around the evolution action means that the calculation is not simply
                the number of pidgies divided by 12 (the cost). Also, you don't want to waste lucky egg time transfering
                pidgies to get a last evolution that could have been done up front.</p>
        <p class="faq">I want &lt;this thing&gt; to change.</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">At the bottom of the page is a small logo. That logo links to the GitHub repository for this application.
                It is open source, you are free to download the source and change it however you like.</p>
