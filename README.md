# Evolve all the Pidgies!

This is a calculator to determine the most efficient action to take with your Pidgies in Pokemon Go. To use it, simply enter the number of Pidgies and Pidgy candies that you have, then click the pokeball. Calculated instructions are then displayed below the pokeball. It assumes that you are transferring the evolved Pidgies (Pidgeotto) as you're evolving them.
